# rsc_taxonomy
Make 'browse pages' and menus from taxonomy vocabularies. Replace the taxonomy page.

## What it does:
- Create menus and menu blocks from taxonomy vocabularies. This is used for the category menus in the left sidebar at www.christianstudylibrary.org and www.ressourceschretiennes.com . It also caches the menu client-side using localStorage, if available.
- Generate the taxonomy term pages (e.g. http://www.christianstudylibrary.org/lib/doctrine-life-ethical-principles )
- TODO: This module should also generate [the browse page](http://www.christianstudylibrary.org/lib/doctrine-life-ethical-principles), but that code is still in rsc_cl
